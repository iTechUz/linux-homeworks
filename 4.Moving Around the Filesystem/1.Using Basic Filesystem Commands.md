## 4.1.1 Using Basic Filesystem Commands

When you log in to a Linux system and open a shell, you are placed in your home directory. 
As a Linux user, most of the files you save and work with will probably be in that directory or in subdirectories that
you create.

**Commands to Create and Use Files**
`cd` - Changes to another directory
`pwd` - Prints the name of the current (or present) working directory
`mkdir` - Creates a directory
`chmod` - Changes the permission on a file or directory
`ls` - Lists the contents of a directory


One of the most basic commands that you use from the shell is cd. The cd command can be used with no options (to take you to your home directory) or with full or relative paths.

Consider the following commands:

`cd /usr/share/`
`pwd`
`cd doc`

The `/usr/share` option represents the absolute path to a directory on the system. Because it begins with a slash (`/`), this path tells the shell to start at the root of the filesystem and take you to the share directory that exists in the usr directory. 

The doc option to the cd command looks for a directory called doc that is relative to the current directory. So that command made `/usr/share/doc` your current directory.
