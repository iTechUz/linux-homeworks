After you type a command, the entire command line is saved in your shellâ€™s history list.
The list is stored in the current shell until you exit the shell. After that, it is written to a
history file, from which any command can be recalled to be run again in your next session.
After a command is recalled, you can modify the command line, as described earlier.
To view your history list, use the history command. Enter the command without options
or followed by a number to list that many of the most recent commands. For example:

`history 18`

1. `!n` - `!22`
2. `!!` -  `!!` 
3. `!?string` - `!?pw?`
