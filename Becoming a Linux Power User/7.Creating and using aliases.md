Using the alias command, you can effectively create a shortcut to any command and options that you want to run later. You can add and list **aliases** with the **alias** command. Consider the following examples of using alias from a bash shell:

```shell
alias p='pwd ; ls â€“CF'
alias kimman='whomai'
alias rm='rm -i'
```

**Task**

1. List all the aliases in your shell
2. Add an alias `'hw'` that will print `'hello world'` to the screen
3. Check what is the `'hw'` command?
4. Remove the `'hw'` alias.
5. Check that it has been removed.
6. Observe what `'ls'` and `'ls -l'` do and what would be the output of `'ls'` if it was not already an alias.
7. Create an alias `'ll'` to do what `'ls -l'` does.
