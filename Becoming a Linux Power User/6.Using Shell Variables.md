## 6.1 Using Shell Variables

### Quyidagi gaplarni o'qing va tushunishga harakat qiling

The shell itself stores information that may be useful to the userâ€™s shell session in what are called variables. Examples of variables include 
- `$SHELL` - (which identifies the shell you are using)
- `$PS1` - (which defines your shell prompt),


You can see all variables set for your current shell by typing the set command. A subset of your local variables is referred to as environment variables. 
Environment variables are variables that are exported to any new shells opened from the current shell. Type **env** to see environment variables.
